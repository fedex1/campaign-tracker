        OPPORTUNITY TO BALLOT PETITION
                  GUIDELINES
            FOR PRIMARY ELECTIONS
These Guidelines are adopted by the Board of Elections in the City of New York
[hereinafter "Board"] and provide guidance in accordance with New York State Election Law
and applicable case law.


Everyone is urged to consult the New York State Election Law and Regulations of the New
York State Board of Elections, 9 NYCRR §6215, as well as these Guidelines.


                                  DEFINITIONS
Petition: A “petition” is one or more sheets, which may be filed with the Board in one
or more volumes, together with any required cover sheet, which nominate the same
candidate for a particular public office.
Petition Volume: A "petition volume" is the petition sheet or in the case of multiple
sheets, the securely fastened grouping of petition sheets for one or more candidates or
group of candidates.

Cover Sheet: A "cover sheet" is the form (as set forth in Section C of these
Guidelines) to be filed with the Board, which summarizes what petition volume or
volumes comprise the Petition for each candidate for a particular public office or party
position.

Election Document: "election document" includes, but is not limited to, a petition,
cover sheet, amended cover sheet, transcripts, minutes, any certificate or document
required to be filed with the Board, pursuant to the Election Law, relating to
qualifying a candidate to appear on the ballot.




                                            1
                         A . GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A1. A designating petition shall comply with the provisions of Section 6-134 of the
    Election Law. An opportunity to ballot petition shall comply with the provisions of
    Section 6-166 of the Election Law. In the case of multiple sheets of the same volume
    of a petition, those sheets shall be securely fastened together in one or more petition
    volumes. The sheets in each petition volume shall be numbered sequentially at the
    bottom of each sheet.

A2. All election documents required to be filed pursuant to Section 1-106 of the Election
    Law shall, unless otherwise provided, be filed between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00
    p.m. at the Executive Office of the Board of Elections, 32 Broadway, 7th Floor, New
    York, N.Y. 10004. If the last day for filing shall fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
    holiday, the next business day shall become the last day for filing. The Board shall be
    open for the receipt of any document from 9:00 a.m. until Midnight on the last day to
    file any such document. The failure of any person or entity to deliver any such
    document to the Board on or before the last day to file same, by midnight, shall be a
    fatal defect.

     Please note that the Board’s offices or supplies may not be used to bind petition volumes
     or prepare cover sheets. Candidates (or their representative) must arrive at the Board
     with their petitions and any other election documents ready to file. This means that all
     election documents must be complete, signed, and bound, with ID number affixed (if
     you already have one). Candidates (or their representative) are encouraged to obtain ID
     numbers, pursuant to Guideline B below, prior to bringing their petitions to the Board to
     file.

     Any petitions which are not ready to file by the filing deadline may not be accepted or
     may be added to the prima facie calendar as a late filing.

A3. Candidates (or their representative) are strongly advised to review the records
    maintained by the Board for public inspection on a regular basis for updated and current
    information which may be relevant to their candidacy.

                        B. IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS
B1. Any petition volume, including a single page petition, shall bear a Board issued
    petition identification number issued in accordance with the provisions of this
    Guideline.



                                                 2
B2. No one is required to apply for a petition volume identification number before filing
    any petition volume. However, any person may apply for a petition volume
    identification number by submission of an Identification Number Application Form.
    Identification Number Application Forms are available at the Board's Candidate
    Records Unit, 32 Broadway, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10004. If a petition volume
    identification number has been assigned before the petition volume is filed, the
    petition volume identification number must appear prominently on the top of the
    petition volume. The Board requests that petition volume identification numbers not
    be placed on the petition volume's binding.

B3. The Board will inscribe petition volume identification numbers on all application
    forms. These forms will be retained in a binder for public inspection.

B4. A pre-assigned petition volume identification number shall be used only by the
    candidate(s) or applicant(s) named in the application. Volume identification numbers
    are not transferable or assignable.

B5. Pre-assigned petition volume identification numbers shall be used only for the election
    event for which the application is made.

B6. Whenever a petition volume (consisting of a single or multiple pages) is filed without
    a pre-assigned petition volume identification number, the Board will assign a petition
    volume identification number at the time the petition volume is filed.

                                   C. COVER SHEET
C1. A cover sheet must be filed for all petitions containing ten or more sheets in one volume
    or consisting of more than one volume. The cover sheet shall be filed separately from
    the petition volume(s). It must not be attached to any petition volume. The failure to file
    a cover sheet where required by the Election Law and these Guidelines is a fatal defect.
    See Seawright v. Bd. of Elections in City of New York, 35 N.Y.3d 227, 234 (N.Y. 2020);
    Matter of Armwood v. McCloy, 109 AD3d 558 (2d Dept. 2013) leave to appeal denied
    21 NY3d 861 (2013).

C2. A cover sheet shall be signed by the candidate or the candidate’s representative with their
    name printed below or next to their signature. The Cover Sheet must contain the
    following information accurately and correctly stated:
a)   the office, the political party's name and district number (where appropriate) for



                                                  3
     which each designation and nomination is being made;
b)   the name and complete residence address of each candidate, which includes the
     house number, the street name, the city, state and zip code for the address. A n
     apartment number, if applicable, is recommended, but optional;
c)   the total number of volumes comprising each petition;
d)   an identification of the volumes comprising the petition; when multiple volumes are
     filed, a single cover sheet must be filed consistent with the Regulations of the New
     York State Board of Elections, 9 NYCRR §6215.2 (a) (2), with the volumes
     identified by listing the identification number of each volume, either individually or
     cumulatively;
e)   a statement that the petition contains the number, or in excess of the number, of valid
     signatures, required by the Election Law or the New York City Charter (if
     applicable);
f)   a place for the optional designation of a contact person to be notified to correct
     noncompliance with the Guidelines (a candidate may be designated as the contact
     person), [A cover sheet may include a fax number and/or e-mail address for the
     contact person to receive communications from the Board.];
g)   when more than one candidate is designated or nominated on the same petition
     volumes, the candidates may be grouped together on a cover sheet so that the
     number of volumes comprising the petition need not be repeated;
h)   a cover sheet may consist of more than one page;
i)   the information contained on the cover sheet must be identical to the information
     printed on the petition sheet for each candidate;
j)   pursuant to Election Law §4-123, a candidate for Member of the New York State
     Assembly or New York State Senate has the option to include on their cover sheet,
     the candidate's website address, which if submitted, will be published on the State
     Board of Elections website.

C3. The names and addresses of candidates for county committee may be set forth by
    election district of candidacy on a schedule to be annexed to the cover sheet. Such
    cover sheet/schedule for the position of county committee shall include all the
    information required by Guideline C2, and in addition, a list by election district of
    the identification number(s) of the petition volume and page number(s) in such
    petition volume(s) where such signatures appear for each election district.

C4. An amended cover sheet must state on the top of the first page that it is an “Amended
    Cover Sheet” and shall clearly identify the original cover sheet, which it is amending, by
    attaching a copy of the original cover sheet or the notice of non-compliance to the
    amended cover sheet. The amended cover sheet must contain all the information
    required of a cover sheet. An amended cover sheet must also contain the following



                                                 4
     authentication: "This is to certify I am authorized to file this amended cover sheet",
     unless it has been filed by the candidate themselves. Said authentication must be signed,
     dated and shall include the printed name, address of said candidate or representative, and
     may also include a telephone number, fax number and/or e-mail address.

C5. An amended cover sheet must be filed on or before the last day to file the petition
    unless the amended cover sheet is filed to cure a failure to comply with the Guidelines
    after the Board has made a determination of non-compliance with these Guidelines. In
    that instance, the amended cover sheet must be filed within three (3) business days of
    the date of the Notice of Non-Compliance, issued pursuant to Guideline D of these
    Guidelines.

C6. The Board shall post conspicuously at the front counter at the place of petition filing
    during the petition circulation and filing period a sign with the following notices:

     A COVER SHEET SHALL BE FILED SEPARATELY from
     any petition volume; a cover sheet is not to be attached to any petition volume;

     All Sheets of each Petition Volume consisting of multiple sheets are to be SECURELY
     FASTENED;

     All sheets of each Petition Volume are to be SEQUENTIALLY NUMBERED;

     Please note that the Board’s offices or supplies may not be used to bind petition volumes
     or prepare Cover Sheets;

     If your election documents are not ready to be filed (complete, signed, and bound, with
     ID number affixed, if you already have one), you must leave the Board’s Offices;

     Any petitions which are not ready to file by the filing deadline may not be accepted or
     may be added to the prima facie calendar as a late filing.

C7. If multiple coversheets or amended coversheets for a candidate are filed, the last
    coversheet (or amended coversheet) filed shall be controlling. Simultaneous filings may
    be invalidated. See Murray v Simon, 1194 AD3d 894 (2d Dept. 2021); Ariola v Maio,
    195 AD3d 888 (2d Dept. 2021).




                                                 5
                        D. DETERMINATIONS; CURES
D1. The Board will review the election document to determine whether the election
    document complies with the requirements of the Election Law and these Guidelines.
    Such review shall be limited to matters apparent on the face of the election
    document, the binding of each petition volume, and the numbering of the sheets of a
    petition volume. Such review and such determination shall be without prejudice to
    the Board's determination of objections and specifications of objections filed pursuant
    to the provisions of the Election Law and these Guidelines.

D2. The Board, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3-212(5) of the Election Law,
    authorizes that a Commissioners' Committee composed of one Commissioner from
    each of the political parties represented on the Board, designated by the President
    and Secretary of the Board, to make determinations pursuant to this Guideline. In
    the absence and/or unavailability of the President and/or the Secretary, the
    Commissioner of the same political party with the greatest length of service on the
    Board, who is available, shall make such designation and act in the place of the
    President and/or Secretary who is absent or unavailable. Notice of the time and place
    of such meetings shall be posted at the Executive Office and on the Board's website. In
    the event that the Board or its duly constituted Committee determines that an election
    document does not comply with the Election Law or these Guidelines, the Board
    shall forthwith notify the candidate or candidates named on the election document of
    its determination and the reasons therefore.

D3. Notification of a determination of non-compliance shall be provided in writing by
    overnight delivery to be received on the next business day after the determination is
    made to the contact person, if designated, or if not designated, to the candidate, at the
    address stated on the election document or the cover sheet, as applicable. If the
    candidate files a written authorization signed by the candidate, allowing the Board to
    provide notification via facsimile or electronic mail, the Board may, at its discretion,
    send such notice to the candidate or the contact person, if designated, on the day of the
    determination to the fax number or e-mail address reflected on the signed written
    authorization. The failure to send such voluntary notice via fax or email shall not void
    the written notice sent by mail and does not extend the deadline by which an attempted
    cure of a defect in the election document is due.

D4. Within three (3) business days of the date of a determination that the election
    document does not comply with the Election Law, the Guidelines, and/or the Rules and
    Regulations of the New York State Board of Elections, a candidate (or their




                                                 6
     representative) may cure said violation, if permitted by the Election Law. Cover sheet
     defects shall be corrected by the filing of an amended cover sheet or as directed in the
     notice of non-compliance issued pursuant to Guideline C. Such cure or correction must
     be received by the Board no later than the third (3 rd) business day following such
     determination. Failure to timely file such a cure is a fatal defect. Where multiple
     amended coversheets and/or other documents are filed for a candidate directed in the
     notice of non-compliance, the last amended coversheet or other document, to be filed
     shall be controlling.

D5. If the petition is one for an opportunity to ballot, then the first named person on the
    committee to receive notices or applicant(s) for the identification number or numbers
    under which the petition was filed shall be deemed to be the "candidate" for purposes of
    these Guidelines.

D6. Upon expiration of the (3) business days set forth in Guideline D4, the Board or a
    Commissioners’ Committee established pursuant to Guideline D2, shall review the
    filed attempted cure. If the Board determines that an attempt to cure a defect does not
    comply with these Guidelines or the Election Law, the Board shall notify the
    candidate or candidates named on the election document of its determination and the
    reasons therefore. The Board shall give written notice of such determination and the
    fact that the candidate(s) will not appear on the ballot in accordance with the
    provisions of Section 6-154(4) of the Election Law to the candidate. For party
    positions, such notice may be sent to the contact person, if so designated, or the first
    person named on the committee to fill vacancies or the candidate, at the address stated
    on the election document.

                            E. PRIMA FACIE MATTERS
E1. The Board reviews each election document to ensure compliance with the New York
    State Election Law and its Guidelines. On occasion, the Board determines that it
    appears that an election document, on its face, fails to comply with the requirements of
    the New York State Election Law and is not subject to a cure under Section 6-134(2)
    of the Election Law. In that event, the Board shall notify the candidate or
    designated contact person in writing, of the Board's preliminary finding of a Prima
    Facie defect and advise the candidate/contact person that he/she may appear at the
    commencement of the Board's hearings relating to said election document to contest
    such preliminary finding. Such review, preliminary finding and final determination
    shall be without prejudice to the Board's subsequent determination of objections and
    specifications of objections filed pursuant to the provisions of the Election Law and




                                                7
     these Guidelines.

                         F. EXAMINATION AND COPYING
                            OF ELECTION DOCUMENTS
F1. The Commissioners of the Board, or in their absence, the Executive Director, Deputy
    Executive Director, the Chief Clerks, Deputy Chief Clerks or such other staff as may
    be designated by the Executive Director, shall control the requisition, examination
    and copying of any election document filed with the Board in order to assure that
    candidates, objectors or potential objectors and their representatives have an equal
    and fair opportunity to examine or copy such election documents consistent with
    the needs of the Board to process petitions and specifications of objections.

F2. Any person may obtain a copy of an election document filed with the Board upon
    written application and payment of 25¢ per page.

F3. Election documents shall not be unfastened or taken apart (except by Board staff) while
    examining such document. If a person examining original copies of a document wishes
    to take notes, only an erasable red pencil shall be used. No other writing instrument is
    permitted.

    Absolutely under no circumstances whatsoever shall a member of the public (including a
    candidate, an objector, or their representative) write on an original election document.

                             G. GENERAL OBJECTIONS
G1. A general objection to an election document must be filed at the Executive Office of
    the Board, 32 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10004, 7th Floor. The last day for filing
    general objections shall be three (3) days after the latest date on which any part of
    such election document was filed, even if said election document is subsequently not
    claimed by the candidate(s) appearing thereon.

     NOTE: The Board reserves the right to conduct an inquiry into the facts and
     circumstances of the filing of any document and the application of Guideline G1.

G2. In the event an amended cover sheet or other election document is filed to cure
    noncompliance with these Guidelines and/or the New York State Election Law after
    the last day to file an election document, the general objection and specifications filed
    in support of such general objection shall address only issues raised by the amended



                                                 8
      cover sheet or other amended election document. Such a general objection and
      specifications are without prejudice to any other issues addressed in any timely filed
      general objection and supporting specifications which are addressed to the election
      document. In order to expedite a determination by the Board, objectors are urged to
      file specifications of an objection addressed to an amended cover sheet or other
      election document filed to cure after a determination of noncompliance at the time
      when the general objection is filed.

G3. The general objection shall state the name and address of the objector and the name
    and address of the candidate, party name, and public office or party position as set
    forth on the election document to which the objection is addressed, the title and date of
    the election for which the election document has been filed, and must be signed by
    the objector. If the objection is directed to a petition for opportunity to ballot the
    objection shall identify the public office or party position and petition volume
    identification number.

G4. The general objection shall include a place for the optional designation of a contact
    person to receive notice of any rulings on the objection. The general objection
    should include any telephone numbers, fax numbers and/or email addresses, which
    can be used to provide notice regarding rulings on the objection.

                    H. SPECIFICATIONS OF OBJECTIONS
 H1. Specifications of objections shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of Election
     Law §6-154. The Board recommends that objectors use the sample Specification of
     Objections Worksheet, which is included with the sample forms attached to these
     Guidelines. All such specifications shall substantially comply with the following
     requirements:

a)    For specifications relating to any petition, the volume number, page number, and line
      number of any signature objected to shall be set forth in detail. In addition, any portion
      of any petition, signature line, or witness statement objected to shall be specifically
      identified and reasons given for any such objection;
b)    the total number of signatures objected to shall be set forth and all objections relating to
      a single signature line should be grouped together and if the specifications of objections
      claim that there are an insufficient number of valid signatures in the petition, the
      specifications must state the total number of signatures contained in the petition and the
      total number of signatures, which the objector claims to be invalid;




                                                   9
c)   symbols and/or abbreviations may be used to set forth objections, provided that a sheet
     explaining the meaning of any such symbols and/or abbreviations is attached to the
     specifications; and
d)   all text should be provided using a font size of not less than ten points and formatted for a
     page measuring 8 1/2 x 11 inches, provided however, the use of text and formatting not in
     compliance with the provisions of this subdivision shall not be a fatal defect.

    election document to which the objection is addressed and shall be signed by the
    objector using ink. The specifications of objections must be prepared using a form of
    permanent marking that is not susceptible to fraud (such a permanent marking shall
    include a photocopy and/or computer generated copy of said specifications provided that
    the signature on such copy is in ink). The specifications of objections shall be securely
    fastened together in one or more volumes. Each sheet of the specifications of objections
    shall be numbered sequentially at the bottom of each page. The specifications shall
    include the name and mailing address of any contact person, other than the objector,
    to receive notice of any rulings on the specifications. The specifications should also
    include any telephone numbers, fax numbers and/or e mail addresses, which can be
    used to provide notice regarding rulings on specifications.

H4. When an objection is filed that presents a factual issue, which cannot be determined
    from documents on file with the Board, the specifications should set forth the factual
    allegations with particulars. The objector should also submit copies of any documents
    or affidavits with the specifications that are required in order for the Board to rule on the
    issue.

H5. Objectors are warned not to include in the specifications broad, non-specific or
    generic claims or claims which are not supported by documents filed with the Board.
    The Board may dismiss the entire objections as frivolous if specifications include such
    claims.

H6. No specifications of objections will be considered unless the objector filing the
    specifications personally delivers or mails by overnight mail a duplicate copy of the
    specification to each candidate for public office named on the petition or certificate.



                                                  11
     Objections and specifications to a petition for an opportunity to ballot must be served on
     the persons named as the committee to receive notices. In the case of a petition or
     certificate containing candidates for party positions, service of the specifications shall be
     made on either the named candidates or the first person named on the petition's
     committee to fill vacancies. Service shall be made on or before the date of filing of any
     specifications with the Board. Proof of service shall accompany the specifications or be
     received by the end of two business days following the filing of the specifications,
     whichever is later.

     According to the Rules and Regulations of the NYS Board of Elections, a petition or
     certificate shall be considered a separate instrument as to each candidate named therein.
     For purposes of making an objection, an objection may be made against specific
     candidates named on a petition or certificate and not others also named, and in which
     case service of specifications shall only be required upon the candidate or candidates
     against whom objections are made.

H7. Acceptable proof of service includes either:

       i.    An affidavit duly notarized from the person who either personally served the
             specifications or who duly mailed the specifications by overnight mail (stating who
             was served, when they were served, what was served, and by what means); or

       ii. An overnight mailing receipt (including date and time) from the delivery service
           showing the name and address of the overnight mail recipient.

H8. Proof of service of specifications must identify the specification it is related by either:

       i.    Including the borough and General Objection/Specification number on the proof of
             service; or by

       ii.   Attaching the proof of service to a copy of the first page of the specification). Such
             proof of service must be filed in person at the Executive Office of the Board, 32
             Broadway, 7th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10004.

     It is recommended that the original proof of service be filed with the Board. If a copy of
     the proof of service is filed with the Board instead, the copy must contain the following
     authentication: “On ____________ (date), I certify that the attached Proof of Service, is
     a true, exact, complete, and unaltered copy of the front and back of the original, which I
     reviewed or is in my possession. _______________ (sign and print name).”



                                                   12
      The Board will issue a time stamped copy of the filed proof of service which shall serve
      as a receipt for the filed proof of service.

H9. The Board will give notice by overnight mail to the objector and the candidate named in
    such petition or certificate of the date(s) on which the Board will consider the
    specifications filed. This notice will be accompanied by a copy of the Clerks’ Report,
    which contains the Board’s findings and research of specifications. Such notice may be
    given by electronic correspondence in lieu of overnight mail with the consent of the
    objector or the candidate in accordance with section H13 of these Guidelines. The Board
    will provide the objector and candidate or their agent(s) an opportunity to be heard, at
    public hearings held at the Board’s offices, as to the validity of each specific objection.

H10. Upon receipt of Specifications of Objection in a borough office, the Chief Clerk and
     Deputy Chief Clerk (or their designees) shall review said specifications of
     objections on their face and determine if said specifications appear to be frivolous or
     if the objectors lack standing to file such specifications. Upon such a preliminary
     determination by the Chief Clerk and Deputy Chief Clerk, they shall refer their
     preliminary determination to the appropriate Borough’s Commissioners' Committee
     (consisting of the Commissioners for those Boroughs which contain part of a specific
     district or for Citywide offices, the Commissioners' Executive Committee) for
     specifications of objections relating to election documents for all offices and/or
     positions for review. If the appropriate Commissioners' Committee confirms that the
     specifications of objection appear to be frivolous or that the objector(s) lack standing
     to file such specifications, they shall confirm the preliminary determination of the
     Chief Clerk and Deputy Chief Clerk and direct that the specifications of objections
     not be worked on/considered by the borough office staff. Such findings and
     confirmation thereof shall be reported to the Commissioners at the commencement
     of the hearings for their review.

H11. When any determination is made that a certificate or petition is sufficient or insufficient,
     the Board will provide notice of the determination by mail to each candidate named in
     the petition or certificate, and, if the determination is made upon specified objections,
     the objector shall be notified. Such notice may be given by electronic correspondence in
     lieu of mail with the consent of the candidate or the objector in accordance with section
     H13 of these Guidelines. A candidate or objector may designate an attorney or agent to
     receive such notice and/or determination on his or her behalf.

H12. A candidate or objector who wishes to designate an attorney or agent to receive notices
     on their behalf must do so in writing and include the name, address, email and telephone



                                                   13
      number of any such attorney or agent. Any such attorney and/or agent shall be eligible
      to represent any such candidate or objector in any proceeding relating to the
      specifications.

H13. Pertaining to Sections H9 and H11 of these Guidelines, candidates or objectors who
     would prefer to receive such notices electronically, must inform the Board of their
     consent to receive notices by electronic correspondence only. It is recommended that
     candidates or objectors provide such consent on the Cover Sheet or General Objection
     form they file with the Board. A sample of each form is enclosed with these Guidelines.
     Candidates or objectors who would like to continue to receive such notices by mail,
     need not take any further action.

H14. The Board believes that the appropriate forum for determination of allegations of
     forgery or fraud is in an invalidating proceeding commenced in the Supreme Court
     pursuant to Election Law §16-102. Therefore, the Board does not ordinarily rule on
     such allegations. In the rare case where an objector seeks to obtain a ruling from the
     Board on an issue of fraud, or on a factual issue which cannot be determined from
     documents already filed with the Board (such as election documents, registration
     records, etc.), the specifications must set forth the factual allegations with
     particularity. The objector should submit with the specifications copies of any
     documents or affidavits that are required in order for the Board to rule on the issue.
     Notwithstanding such a submission, the Board will generally decline to rule on any
     allegation of fraud.

H15. Specifications of objections must be filed within six (6) days after the filing of
     general objections, in person, at the Executive Office of the Board, 32 Broadway, 7th
     Floor, New York, N.Y. 10004. The Executive Office will be open during the period for
     filing objections and specifications until midnight of each day (except Saturday and
     Sunday) to permit the filing of such papers in person. The Election Law does not
     authorize the extension of time for filing objections or specifications.

                       I. CLERKS'/COUNSEL’S REPORT
I(1). The Chief Clerk and Deputy Chief Clerk of each borough shall assign staff to
      examine the specifications of objections and to prepare a report to the Commissioners
      (“Clerks’ Report”).

I(2). As soon as the borough office has prepared the Clerks’ Report, the borough office
      shall fax and/or e-mail copies of the Clerks’ Report to the objectors, candidates,



                                                14
      and/or contact persons designated. Candidates or objectors who are unable to receive
      faxes or e-mails must check with the Chief Clerk or Deputy Chief Clerk of the
      respective borough office if the candidate or objector wishes to review the Clerks'
      Report prior to the Commissioners' hearing.

I(3). At least twenty-four hours before each date for Commissioners' hearings, each
      borough office shall prepare a list of Clerks' Reports, which have not been
      completed and shall immediately transmit a copy to the Executive Office and shall
      make the list available to the public. The Commissioners' hearing on Clerks' Reports
      included on the list will be automatically postponed from the immediate hearing date to
      the next hearing date scheduled by the Commissioners unless there is consent from
      the objector and the candidate to rule on the Clerks' Report as scheduled.

I(4). Once the borough office has prepared the report to the Commissioners, the original
      specifications of objections with the line by line rulings of the clerks will be made
      available for examination or copying by the objector, candidate or representative,
      provided that the specification is not being used by the clerks for the review of any
      other specifications of objections.

I(5). Guideline F regarding examination and copying of petitions shall also apply to
      specifications of objections showing the clerks' line by line rulings. The use of
      designating or OTB petitions and specifications by the clerks for the preparation of
      their report shall have priority over any request for examination or copying by any
      objector, candidate or their representative.

I(6). In the event that the specifications of objection present legal rather than or in addition
      to factual issues, said specifications of objections shall be referred to the Office of
      the General Counsel of the Board to prepare a report to the Commissioners on the
      legal issues raised in the specifications. The Office of the General Counsel shall
      provide a copy of the Counsel’s Report via email to the objector/contact person and
      candidate/contact person no later than twenty-four hours prior to the Commissioners'
      hearing.

                                       J. HEARINGS
J1.   The Commissioners shall render a ruling on specifications of objections after they
      receive the Clerks' or Counsel's Report. Candidates or objectors who wish to be
      heard by the Commissioners should review the Clerks'/Counsel's Report and
      individual line-by-line rulings prior to the Commissioners' hearing. Candidates or




                                                  15
      objectors shall present to the Commissioners at the commencement of the hearing
      for that objection, a list of exceptions which identifies with specificity each ruling by
      the clerks or recommendation of the Board's Counsel, which is claimed to be
      erroneous. In view of the short deadlines and urgency of obtaining final rulings by
      the Board, the Board may reject any application for an extension of time to review
      the Clerks'/Counsel's Report when the candidate or objector received notice of the
      Clerks'/Counsel's Report at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the hearing
      (including weekends and holidays), or the candidate or objector failed to designate a
      fax number or e-mail address for the receipt of notice.

J2.   Attorneys appearing on behalf of a candidate or objector must file a Notice of
      Appearance on the Board prepared form, which shall include the current address,
      telephone number, fax number and e-mail address of the attorney.

J3.   An individual, other than an attorney (including a candidate or objector), representing
      a candidate or an objector must file a Notice of Authorization that must be signed by
      said candidate or objector. Notices of Appearance and/or Authorization can be
      obtained from the Candidate Records Unit as well as the front counter in the
      Commissioners' Hearing Room on hearing days.

J4.   The hearings held by the Board and its designated committees shall be recorded and
      publicly available on the Board’s website.

J5.   Whenever there is not a quorum of Commissioners present on any day scheduled for
      Commissioners' hearings, a committee of the Commissioners shall rule on the Clerks'
      or Counsel's Reports. The committee is constituted pursuant to Election Law §3-212
      (5). The committee shall consist of the largest equal number of Commissioners from
      each of the political parties represented on the Board who are available and
      designated by the President and Secretary of the Board, who may make such
      designation by telephone. In the absence of the President or the Secretary, the
      Commissioner of the same political party with the greatest length of service on the
      Board who is available shall make such designation. The President and Secretary,
      or senior Commissioners present shall attempt to confer with the other Commissioners
      of the same political party before making such designation. The committee shall
      serve only for that hearing date, or until a quorum of the full Board is present,
      whichever is shorter, unless the full Board shall provide otherwise.

J6.   Pursuant to the provisions of Section 6-154(4) of the Election Law, the Board shall
      give written notice to each candidate the Board determines will not appear on the
      ballot for the failure to comply with the requirements of the Election Law and/or



                                                 16
      these Guidelines. If that determination is made upon specific objections, the objector
      shall be given written notice that the candidate(s) will not appear on the ballot. The
      Board shall give such written notice in accordance with the provisions of Section 6-
      154(4) of the Election Law to the candidate named in the election document at the
      address stated on the election document and the objector at the address stated on the
      objection.

J7.   Prior to the commencement of each session of the petition hearings, a copy of the
      Prima Facie Calendar(s) (compiled by the Candidate Records Unit and/or the Office
      of General Counsel) and the Specifications of Objections Calendar(s) for that
      session shall be posted at or near the entrance of the hearing room for public
      inspection.

                         K. JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
K1. Judicial proceedings are governed by Article 16 of the New York State Election Law.
    The Commissioners adopted a policy statement and recommended provision for
    inclusion in any proposed Order to Show Cause sought pursuant to §16-102 of the
    Election Law. The attention of all candidates, objectors and their legal counsel is
    directed to the following:

      NOTICE TO CANDIDATES, OBJECTORS AND
      THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL
                      Orders to Show Cause under § 16-102 of the
                            New York State Election Law

      The Commissioners of Elections in the City of New York at their public meeting held
      on Tuesday, June 18, 2012 adopted the following policy statement and recommended
      provision for inclusion in any proposed Orders to Show Cause sought pursuant to
      Section 16-102 of the New York State Election Law.

      In the past, the Orders to Show Cause brought under §16-102 often imposed mandates
      and obligations on the Board, that interfered with the activities of the Board and its
      staff and at a cost to the Board and the City's taxpayers. These Orders to Show Cause
      which have often been obtained on an ex-parte basis naming the Board of Elections, a
      governmental entity without notice or the opportunity to be heard.




                                                17
By way of background, in prior years, on the initial return date for an Order to Show
Cause in a special proceeding commenced under §16-102, usually no action is taken
since the Board may not have yet completed its administrative hearings on Specification
of Objections and Prima Facie findings. Under this proposed provision, when included
by the Supreme Court in an Order to Show Cause, at a later stage in the litigation,
when documents may actually be needed, the Court may direct the Board to produce
the necessary documents and only the necessary documents. In addition, most of the
Supreme Court's Election Parts conduct their line-by-line reviews of petitions at the
Board's borough offices; adoption of this proposed provision would not result in a
drastic change in the Supreme Court's practice.

Please note that the Commissioners directed that this attached recommended
provision be made widely available by:
1. posting this Notice on the Board's website;
2. distributing copies of this Notice during petition filing weeks to each candidate,
    representative and objector;
3. transmitting a copy to each Administrative Judge of the Civil Terms of State
    Supreme Court within the City of New York requesting that they distribute the
    same to the Justices assigned to the Special Election Matters Part(s) and the Ex-
    Parte or Motion Support Office staff.

This policy and the recommended provision for inclusion in an Order to Show Cause
are applicable to all §16-102 matters, be they for a Primary, General and/or Special
Election.

In addition, the Commissioners at their public meeting held on Tuesday, April 6, 2021,
further adopted Recommended Provisions for Inclusion in Orders to Show Cause
pertaining to Primary Elections and Municipal Special Elections conducted using
Ranked Choice Voting.

Be advised, the Office of the General Counsel (herein “OGC”) must be notified of the
date and time a litigant intends to appear before the court to request that an Order to
Show be signed. If an Order to Show Cause is entered that contains contrary provisions,
through the New York City Law Department, the OGC will appear and oppose the
inclusion of such a provision in the Order to Show Cause or seek its modification to
include the recommended provision set forth below.

The Board of Elections in the City of New York thanks each candidate and/or their
legal counsel for their cooperation and understanding.

               RECOMMENDED PROVISION FOR INCLUSION IN
                        ORDERS TO SHOW CAUSE
                   RELATING TO THE PRODUCTION OF
                     DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS IN
                  SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED
                 UNDER §16-102 AND RELATED PROVISIONS

               Adopted by the Commissioners of Elections in the City of New York
                       on June 18, 2012. (Amended February 14, 2023)


       ORDERED, that Respondent Board of Elections, in accordance with Section 3-220
(6) of the New York State Election Law and the duly adopted Guidelines of the Board of
Elections in the City of New York, shall make available at the office of the Board where
such records are maintained in the ordinary course of business during normal business hours,
the aforesaid designating/independent nominating petition, cover sheet, and any amended
cover sheet(s), identification number application form(s), and any other documents in
support of or related to designation and/or nomination of the Candidate; together with the
Objections and Specifications of Objections relating to the aforesaid petition; any written
notification of a determination of non-compliance together with proof of service upon the
Candidate; any writing purporting to cure or correct said determination of non-compliance as
well as the determination of said Board on any Specifications of Objections. Any party
seeking copies of the aforesaid documents shall, upon payment of the applicable fee as
established by law and/or regulation, receive the same in the ordinary course of business.
